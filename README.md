# Hi there, I'm ClÃ©ment ðŸ‘‹

I'm a state-certified software engineer based in Strasbourg, France.  
I wrote my first HTML pages at 14, caught the dev bug early, and never looked back.

Like many, I started web development with LAMP stacks, but also had the chance to work with Python, C++, and Node.js.  
After my studies, I helped grow a startup in the healthcare industry, working hands-on with custom boards, networking, Linux systems, and more.  
Later, I spent five years building data-intensive cloud applications at PrestaShop using event sourcing, CI/CD, automated testing, and a strong DevOps culture.

Over the years, I've worn many hats: backend & frontend developer, lead dev, international presales engineer, and team manager.

## ðŸ›  What I like to work with

- TypeScript / JavaScript â€“ especially Node.js (since the early days!)
- Linux, Ansible, Docker, ZFS
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, React
- Jira (not really â€” just kidding ðŸ˜„)
- Still discovering Rust atm!

And more generally: distributed systems, open source, clean code, and automation.

I'm always curious and passionate about building robust systems, sharing knowledge, and learning from others.
